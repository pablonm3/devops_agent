## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Conda (recommended for environment management)
- Mac or Linux machine
- Telegram account
- Anthropic API key (for Claude)
- OpenAI API key (for Whisper transcription)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devops_agent.git
cd devops_agent
```

2. Set up the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate devops_agent
```

3. Configure your environment variables (see Configuration section below)

## Setting Up Your Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for "BotFather" (@BotFather)
2. Send the command `/newbot` to BotFather
3. Follow the instructions to name your bot and create a username for it
4. Once created, BotFather will provide you with a **token** that looks like `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`
5. Save this token as you'll need it for configuration

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token_here"
TELEGRAM_USER_ID="your_telegram_user_id" 
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
LLM_MODEL="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"
```

To find your Telegram user ID:
1. Send a message to @userinfobot on Telegram
2. It will reply with your user ID

## Running the Bot

### Telegram Bot

To start the Telegram bot:

```bash
python telegram_bot.py
```

### CLI Bot (local usage)

For local command line usage:

```bash
python cli_bot.py
```

## Usage

Once your bot is running, you can:

1. Send text messages to the bot with commands or questions
2. Send voice messages that will be transcribed and processed
3. Create custom tasks by sending a message like "Create a task to check system status"
4. Run shell commands by asking the bot to perform specific actions
5. Get help by asking the bot about its capabilities

## Security Considerations

- The bot only responds to the Telegram user ID specified in your `.env` file
- API keys should be kept secret and never committed to version control
- The bot can execute shell commands on your machine, so ensure it's running in a secure environment
- Consider using a restricted user account for running the bot in production

## Creating Custom Tasks

You can create custom automation tasks that can be executed later:

1. Ask the bot to create a new task: "Create a task called check_disk that checks disk space"
2. The bot will help you define the steps and commands for the task
3. Once created, you can run the task by name: "Run check_disk task"
